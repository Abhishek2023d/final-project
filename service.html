        <p>our 1000 square foot space allows us to carry everything you would look for in a gym! We have filled the gym with top of the line machines, weights and workout accessories to help all of our members reach their personal goals. We have a large class room that holds 80+ classes a week featuring zumba, yoga, pilates, muscle conditioning, trx and much more. Our spinning classes are allocated in a different room and holds 40 bikes. Our class areas are big enough to allow no pre-registration, this makes working out a worry free and easy task. In the last two years we have added a new section to our gym which is the turf area, this section is a multi purpose space where you are free to push our weighted sled, flip our tire, use our trx and much more.</p>
